Portfolio of an Inexperienced Web Engineer

## Overview
I have been learning for about a year and am working on developing websites and web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.

In my development environment, I use gulp to support efficient development. gulp allows me to automate tasks such as Sass compilation and automatic reloading via Browsersync. I also use webpack and Babel to bundle and transpile JavaScript modules.

My specialties include the following
- Implementing beautiful responsive designs using HTML and CSS
Creating easy-to-use interfaces that users are comfortable with in layout and UI construction

- Implementation of interactive features utilizing JavaScript
We can add dynamic elements and animations using JavaScript to encourage user interaction.

- Back-end development using PHP
We can also work on server-side development, such as processing user data and interfacing with databases.

In the future, I hope to hone a broader range of skills as I gain practical experience and become a professional web engineer.
